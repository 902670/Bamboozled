Hi! Thanks for reading my README!
This is my first time doing this, and this app started as a weekend project.
If you're thinking about installing Bamboozled, here's what you need to know:

    ABOUT:
*=*=*=*=*=*=*

Bamboozled is an Android app for monitoring Bambu Labs printers. In using my P1S, I was frusturated by the Bambu Handy app.
There were so many chances for this app to be amazing. Live notifications! Widgets! Material 3 theming! None of which are actullay in the app of course.
So I took matters into my own hands.

WHAT IT DOES:

Bamboozled gives you a pretty little dashboard for monitoring your 3D printer.
It follows dynamic color, looks pretty good, and best of all, puts the print progress right on your lock screen!

HOW IT WORKS:
*=*=*=*=*=*=*

It's really simple! Bamboozled uses the MQTT wi-fi protocol.
Unfortunately, this means you need to be connected to the same wi-fi network as your printer for this to work.
To get started, click the settings menu in the top right of the app. The relevant information can be found on your printers screen. (Except sireal number on P series printers. Its in Bambu studio.)
Click save and you're good to go!

    TIPS:

It dosen't work perfectly. I really want to stress that this is a personal free-time project.
If you connected but the print progress is not being shown, refresh Bambu handy. This forces the data packet including print progress to be sent to your device
For some reason notifications are disabled by default. Turn them on to make full use of the app. I also reccomend turning off the notification dot.

Thank you for downloading Bamboozled!
Happy printing!
